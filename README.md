# SATMesh

SATMesh is a **secure messaging** application that works **without Internet**. It relies on **Bluetooth** and **Wi-Fi** connections to transmit messages—even over long distances—using a **deterministic multi-hop routing** mechanism.

## ✨ Main Features

- Text messaging between Android devices without Internet access
- End-to-end encryption based on the Signal protocol
- Multi-hop message routing to reach distant nodes
- Secure local storage using SQLCipher
- Nearby peer discovery via Nearby Connections
- Smooth and intuitive conversational interface

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) – Native Android development
- [Google Nearby Connections](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview) – Proximity-based communication
- [Signal Protocol](https://signal.org/docs/) – End-to-end encryption
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) – Local database
- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) – Encrypted SQLite storage
